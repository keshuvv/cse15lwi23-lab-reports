# Lab Report 5 

## For this lab report, I have chosen the `find` command. Following are some of the command line options for `find` that I found interesting:_ 

## 1. `-size` option 
   * Description:

   * Example 1: 
   * Example 2: 
   
## 2. `-type` option 
   * Description: 
                  [Source](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)
        
   * Example 1: 
   * Example 2: 
  

## 3. `-empty` option
   *  Description: 
                  [Source](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)
           
   * Example 1: 
   * Example 2: 

## 4. `-m NUM` option (can also be used as `--max-count=NUM`)
   * Description: Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If NUM is
                  zero, grep stops right away without reading input.  A NUM
                  of -1 is treated as infinity and grep does not stop; this
                  is the default.  If the input is standard input from a
                  regular file, and NUM matching lines are output, grep
                  ensures that the standard input is positioned to just
                  after the last matching line before exiting, regardless of
                  the presence of trailing context lines.  This enables a
                  calling process to resume a search.  When grep stops after
                  NUM matching lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.
                  When the -c or --count option is also used, grep does not
                  output a count greater than NUM.  When the -v or
                  --invert-match option is also used, grep stops after
                  outputting NUM non-matching lines.
