# Lab Report 1 

## 1. Installing VScode
   * Step 1: Click on this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com) to go to the Visual Studio Code website.
   * Step 2: Follow the instructions given on the website to download and install it on your computer. Please make sure to download the version that is most suitable for your operating systsem. 
   * Step 3: Once installed, open the application on your system. You should be able to see a window like the one given here below ![Image](images/VSC.png)
   * Step 4: Your Vistual Studio Code environemnt is ready now! 
   
   
## 2. Remotely Connecting 
   * Step 1: To use `ssh`, open a terminal in VScode or use `Ctr` / `Command` + ```. 
   * Step 2: Use the command `$ ssh cs15lwi23abn@ieng6.ucsd.edu` on the terminal. Make sure that you replace `abn` with the letters from your course-specific account. Also, note that we write `$` as a convention for how we write commands. 
   * Step 3: If this is your first time connecting to this server, you will probably get a message like this:
`â¤‡ ssh cs15lwi23abn@ieng6.ucsd.edu 
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?`
   * Step 4: Please type `yes` and then your password to move forward. Now, you should be able to see a window like the one given here below ![Image](images/ssh.png)
   * Step 5: You are now logged into your remote server! 
  

## 3. Trying Some Commands
   * Try running the commands `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `pw` on the terminal a few times. 
   * Use these commands in different ways to understand their usage and make a note of it.
   * A few other commands that you can try are: `cd ~`, `..`, `ls -a`, `ls -lat`, `ls <directory>` where `<directory>` is `/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/cs15lwi23abn`. Remember to replace `abn` with the letters from your course-specific account, and `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt ~/`
   * You should expect to see results like these ![Image](images/commands.jpg)
